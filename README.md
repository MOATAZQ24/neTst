**Learn Networking Smarter, One Quiz at a Time**  

neTst is a modern web-based platform for networking students and enthusiasts who want to practice and improve their knowledge of computer networking and Cisco certifications (e.g., CCNA, CCNP).  

The platform focuses on **dynamic quizzes**, **progressive difficulty levels**, and **answer explanations** — making it a practical training tool instead of just a question dump.
